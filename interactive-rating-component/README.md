## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Vanilla JavaScript
- DOM manipulation (editing classlist, etc.)
- Dynamic webpages (toggling between the rating and the thank you state)


### What I learned

This was much more of a challenge to me! The nature of JavaScript, coming from C/C++, takes some getting used to (e.g. there's no low-level coding such as memory management).
However, some of the provided colors didn't really match what was displayed in the image, and a lot of time was spent replacing/trying to find alternatives.
