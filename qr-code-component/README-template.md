### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

Most of this I knew from beforehand, so it wasn't particularly hard. However, I did learn that if using a pecentage for an element's padding, it's a percentage of the parent's dimensions. This got me scratching my head for a couple of minutes.


### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://css-tricks.com/oh-hey-padding-percentage-is-based-on-the-parent-elements-width/) - This explained my padding problem mentioned above.
